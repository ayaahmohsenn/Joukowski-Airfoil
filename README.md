# Joukowski-Airfoil
The joukowski airfoil is generated using a type of conformal mapping called “joukowski transform”. In this problem,  the pressure coefficient on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil
To get the pressure coefficients and the velocity 𝑢𝑧 − 𝑖𝑢𝑥 to free stream velocity 𝑉∞, we have
first, Identify all the constants such as free stream velocity and chord length, and variables that are
changing from case to another case such as angle of attack, Maximum camber to chord ratio , and
Maximum thickness to chord ratio, of the four cases.

Then, make for loop from the first to the last case, and this loops on the three variables of the
problem and inside of it another two loops; one for upper surface from leading to trailing edge, and
another for lower surface from leading to trailing edge, and we have the procedure from previous
section to get the pressure coefficient and the velocity contour. 

case 1: 𝛼 = 2, chamber length/ chord length = 0.03, Thickness/chord =0.05. 
case 2: 𝛼 = 4, chamber length/ chord length = 0.05, Thickness/chord =0.07. 
case 3: 𝛼 = 9, chamber length/ chord length = 0.06, Thickness/chord =0.1. 
case 4: 𝛼 = 2, chamber length/ chord length = 0.07, Thickness/chord =0.12.
